### Boston Route 19

Hello.
This is my homework on the *animated map*

Displays the location of one bus on the route 19 in Boston.

Cycle (update time) is every 15 sec. But I noticed the bus sometimes only moves once every 2 cycles. So be patient.

In case you leave the page unattended it will only run for 50 cycles.

## Important

If the **occupancy status** reports null, the bus is probably not running. You would have to wait some time until the bus runs again.
Added some code to look between bus[0] and bus[10] for the first active bus.
